Sign in Report this job Project Overview We are seeking one or more Postdoctoral Associates, Research Engineers, or Research Scientists in social sciences or related fields to join a project on “Designing human-AI teams.” The project is part of a five-year research program on ""Mens, Manus and Machina—How AI Empowers People, Institutions and Cities in Singapore (M3S)."" Successful applicants for this position will have the opportunity to work on cutting-edge, interdisciplinary projects that aim to dramatically rethink how people and AI systems will work together in the future . To do this, the project seeks to build a strong scientific foundation for how AI can augment (as opposed to replace) humans. One important goal of the project is to develop a rich taxonomy of activities that can be performed by human-AI teams. Like mapping the plants and animals on an unexplored continent, the work will involve cataloging many (a) activities and (b) possible human-computer processes for performing these activities. To do this, we will develop knowledge bases that include (1) descriptions of many different types of activities and processes, and (2) classifications of these descriptions into taxonomies that range from very general types of activities to very specific ones. Then, using these knowledge bases, we will develop AI tools to automatically generate promising ways of combining humans and AI systems to perform different tasks. In the long run, we believe these tools will help rapidly (a) identify use cases for new AI capabilities, (b) specify effective processes and task allocations to humans and computers in a given situation, and (c) identify innovative ways to combine people and AI to solve business and societal problems. The T6 team is led by distinguished scholars, including Profs. Thomas Malone, Daniela Rus, and Abdullah Almaatouq from MIT; and Profs. Marcelo Ang and Bryan Low from the National University of Singapore; and will be assisted by Prof. Archan Misra from Singapore Management University. Job Description Successful candidates for this job will participate in one or more activities like the following: Developing descriptions of current or potential activities and processes based on techniques such as: interviews, surveys, field studies, ethnographic observations, and literature reviews. Making editorial decisions about what content to include in the knowledge base, how to present it clearly, and how to organize it in ways that are logical, comprehensive, widely understandable, intuitively appealing, and conceptually elegant. Using human-subject experiments and other social science methodologies (such as cluster analysis) to help improve the above activities as well as to inform and evaluate the development of software tools based on the knowledge bases being developed. Collaborate with the project team and other researchers to design, implement, and evaluate research projects. Perform other duties as needed. Job Requirements Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Social Science (such as Psychology, Sociology, Political Science, and Economics), Management, Organizational Behavior, Philosophy, Journalism, Computer Science (e.g., with a focus on Human-Computer Interaction) Excellent communication and collaboration skills This role is primarily based in Singapore.

If so, we would like to meet you. Here is what we offer in a nutshell: A wide array of extremely challenging C++ development tasks An international team of brilliant minds A working environment that makes this team stay and grow Enough time to make sure that every detail of your solution is perfect A flat organization and plenty of room for your ideas No scheduled meetings Family-friendly working hours, no deadlines, no overtime Support for relocation A competitive salary from the start and a raise to EUR 130,000 annually after only one year About us think-cell is a fast-paced software company in Berlin, Germany, with a focus on developing graphics products that stand out from the crowd. More than 1,000,000 users world-wide rely on our software for their daily business as it makes creating graphical presentations so much easier, faster and more enjoyable. Among our customers are many renowned consulting companies and large international corporations. We do not have to make compromises with regard to code quality and beauty, because think-cell is highly profitable. We are willing to go the extra mile of developing sophisticated algorithms and refining our user interface, and we are proud of our many happy customers. The fact that the company is owned and managed by seasoned computer scientists certainly contributes to a working environment that makes exceptional developers come and stay. About our software Our focus is on business slides (as opposed to more artful applications) because they offer great potential for automation of layout tasks that are traditionally performed by PowerPoint users themselves. Challenges are plenty: from a solid understanding of what makes a good layout and which guidelines are followed by humans who do manual layout, to algorithms that produce an acceptable output fast enough for interactive slide design, to a graphical user interface that supports our new, original approach to slide layout in a way that is easy to understand yet unobtrusive, to solid technical solutions for automatic bug reporting and automatic updates, to compatibility with third-party software on the computers of half a million users. Here are some highlights of what we have done. Language Everything we do is C++. Even our customer portal is written in C++. There is some Assembler glue code where it is necessary, and our build scripts are written in Python, but other than that think-cell is all about C++. We closely track the latest versions of our compilers, Visual C++ and Xcode, so we can always use the latest C++ standard features as soon as they become available. We fund the working group for programming languages of the German Institute for Standardization (DIN). Some of our employees are members of this committee and vote in the international standardization process of ISO/IEC C++. We sponsor the Standard C++ Foundation helping them to promote the understanding and use of modern Standard C++ on all compilers and platforms. Library We use Boost throughout our code, e.g., Boost.Spirit for parsing. We have our own range library, in the same spirit as Boost.Range or Eric Niebler’s range-v3, but going further, for example, by unifying internal and external iteration. We gave a talk about it, and most of the code is public. We develop our own cross-platform library to support Mac and Windows with a single code base. We have our own reference-counting and persistence libraries to save and restore whole object trees. We have an extensive bug reporting infrastructure. Assertions and error checks stay in the release code, and our software automatically reports bugs to our server. The server analyzes the bug, categorizes it and files it in a database that all developers can access. If an update fixes the bug, the user can download the update directly from a bug response web page. Algorithms think-cell was founded on the idea for an algorithm for automatic slide layout, and we are still on an exciting journey towards that ambitious vision. You can see our most recent release in action! We developed a new algorithm for automatic point cloud labeling that allows labels to be positioned away from the actual points. We developed a new algorithm for automatic column chart labeling. We are working with John Forrest – author of the linear solver CLP – to make his simplex code faster on our kind of problems. We developed many generic data structures that are not in C++ or Boost, for example partitions. Our software not only produces charts, it is also able read them back from paper. For our chart recognition tool, we rely on OpenCV and the Leptonica Image Processing Library. Reverse Engineering We do lots of reverse engineering with the disassembler IDA from Hex-Rays, in order to achieve things that are not possible via the documented Microsoft Office API. We wrote probably the best function hooking engine out there. On each start of our software, we patch the Microsoft Office executables in memory. Rather than hard-coding patch addresses, we search for small chunks of assembly code to be robust against minor changes in the executables. About this job We are looking for bright, creative Developers (f/m/d) with a solid theoretical background. Our team of Developers consists of a wide range of people, from recent graduates in Computer Science, Physics and Mathematics to Developers with 10+ years of experience. A university degree or work experience with C++, together with a fresh and creative problem-solving approach would be an excellent combination for the role. We love working with talented people, whether you are a student, fresh graduate, or a C++ expert, therefore our recruitment process is skills-based consisting of tasks related to the role. You will work largely independently and will be responsible for the whole range of activities when implementing a new feature. You should be able to look at a problem from the user's perspective and discuss abstract concepts with fellow developers. We expect each of our developers to do architecture, design, implementation, customer feedback and bug fixing, rather than splitting these activities between several people. We thus put everyone in control of their own work. At think-cell, there are no deadlines, and no scheduled meetings. A feature is ready to be released when you are convinced that you have implemented the best possible solution. Meetings take place as needed, with only the people that are actually involved being required to be present. At any time in the process, ideas, suggestions and criticism from anybody in the hierarchy is welcome and is seriously considered. Your ideas are welcome, even if they mean that we have to change a lot of code to make things better. We have published several scientific articles in the areas of Artificial Intelligence and Computer Graphics and we will encourage you to do the same. We sponsor visits to conferences and have close relationships with universities and research institutes in the U.S. and Germany. think-cell encourages a healthy work-life balance. We do not work at night or on weekends. We pay very competitive salaries and offer our developers EUR 130,000 annually following one year of employment. If necessary, we will go out of our way to help you relocate to Berlin, and will do what we can to help you acquire a work permit. While you should be able to communicate effectively in English, knowing German is not required. German language courses can be arranged, if desired.

Join us in shaping the future of payments and commerce. Let's pave the way for a world where businesses can fully realise their payment potential. There isn’t a single grand definition for what a Solution Engineer (or SE) is. Depending on where you’ve worked, talked to, or even read you might find a number of definitions for it. At Primer, SEs are a merchant’ trusted advisor and technical partner. From their first meeting with Primer, all the way until go-live, SEs are there to work with our merchants. This means everything from running demos, workshops, debugging issues, and everything that it takes to make merchant’ payments experience the best. What you'll be doing? Working closely with our growing sales team to identify merchant pain points; and consulting with those merchants on the value of Primer to address those pain points Providing technical expertise to the sales team to partner with them in business development Translating business requirements into technical solutions, and translating complex technical concepts into simple language Driving forward client engagements via discovery sessions, solution design workshops, product demos, developer Q&As, and more Collaborating with our Product team, using your market learning to identify feature enhancements, as well as new features entirely, that we can bring to market to best serve our merchants What are we looking for? Previous experience in a merchant facing role with a complex API product, ideally in payments Confidence and ease in leading discovery sessions, joining presentations at C-level, and working with technical counterparts at some of the largest merchants Deep interest or knowledge about tech. Being able to understand, explain, and design complex technical specifications is key. Creativity and improvisational skills. Rarely are two merchants alike, and you don’t always have days to prepare for them. Great communication & presentations skills - you can make the complicated sound simple and interact with stakeholders, technical and non-technical, alike A collaborative approach - to efficiently work with clients, partners, and internally, with Product, Engineering, and Sales Drive and motivation; we’re growing fast and we want you to grow with us!

Startups are a challenge, building category defining products is a challenge. You should be prepared for a challenge at Primer. But, there’s a big difference between a challenge and a struggle. The key difference is that the right challenge comes with the right support structures, an acceptance that not everything always goes to plan, a collaborative environment, and a great team around you.
