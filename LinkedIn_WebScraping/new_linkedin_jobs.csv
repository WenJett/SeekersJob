Thales established its presence in Singapore in 1973 to support the expansion of aerospace-related activities in the Asia-Pacific region. Throughout the last four decades, the company grew from strength to strength and is today involved in the primary businesses of Aerospace (including Air Traffic Management), Defence & Security, Ground Transportation and Digital Identity & Security. Thales today employs over 2,100 people in Singapore across all its business areas. The Aviation Innovation Research (AIR) Lab The joint CAAS-Thales innovation lab known as ‘AIR Lab’ started to operate on 1st November 2019 with the objective to develop Proof of Concepts (POCs) or Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) of advanced and open technologies for future Air Traffic Management (ATM). Currently, the joint lab employs a team of 40 Thales engineers and 12 CAAS engineers and air traffic controllers operating in a vibrant ecosystem involving a number of Singaporean SMEs and start-ups, as well as key research institutes. Thales engineers include 10 domain experts – with more than 10 years of experience – coming from Thales ATM centers of competence in France and Australia.

We're on the lookout for those who are well-versed in the intricate details of operations, from small things like OS installations and break-fix to high-impact projects like planning and operations (covering the full infrastructure lifecycle) to the new design-build facilities or renovations to existing systems. • Monitoring: Your knowledge should transcend the ordinary; we prefer intermediate-level skills. We expect you to be a maestro in the orchestration of tools and designs for monitoring server health, network switches, and the power and temperature conditions of the data center. • Automation: We welcome those who have delved into the realm of automation, ideally at an intermediate level.

RICE is the strategic risk framework for the Fixed Income business at Morgan Stanley and is developed by a group of teams within IST. Our group provides both the development environment and the runtime environment for the RICE Platform. The DAL team is responsible for the data storage and access functionality in the platform. Description We build RICE (RIsk Calculation Environment) - a ground-breaking, highly integrated, functional Scala platform that powers the firm’s fixed income risk management and the next generation of trading applications. Multiple teams collaborate on technologies including bitemporal object stores, asynchronous language semantics, compiler development, massively distributed computation, embedded query languages, and declarative reactive UIs. Our focus on core platform development means that our primary clients are not the teams and individuals operating on the financial side, but their end-user application developers, who rely on the services and components we provide. We are looking for a senior software engineer to join the Data Access Layer (DAL) team which builds the servers and clients for storage, access, and global distribution of data within the platform. Integrating with open-source technologies such as MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and Kafka, and with both internal and external cloud platforms, we develop a cutting-edge performant, distributed, and strongly-consistent store which provides data for everything from large compute grids to front-office UI applications. We are seeking experienced team members to join our global team, taking up ownership of technical deliverables and guiding other team members. Role Profile You should be a technically proficient and enthusiastic developer, with a desire to work on the full stack in order to help engineer new and existing components. You will work on new and existing components in Scala (which we can help you learn) in an agile team working across multiple time zones. You will support and lead different phases of the product lifecycle including analysis, development and testing. You will suggest improvements to our systems and processes and over time you will take ownership for some areas. You will collaborate closely with very experienced Scala developers and have the opportunity to learn and grow in this role. Your clients will be application developers and you will work with them to understand and deliver their requirements. The role is a great opportunity to work in a technically challenging environment on some large-scale problems core to the business. Required Skills Intermediate and senior level developers with strong problem-solving and analytical skills. Technically curious, with a natural inclination to dig beneath the surface to understand how things work, why they are a certain way and what the design trade-offs were. Our main development language is Scala, but prior knowledge of Scala is not required -- we are seeking skilled technologists proficient in any of C++, Java, Scala, .Net, or similar languages. Good understanding of core computer science concepts and code optimization techniques. An understanding that testing and documentation is critical to delivering high quality solutions. Desired Skills Experience working with a variety of SQL and no-SQL datastores is helpful but not at all required. Prior experience in the financial industry is not required, but comfort working with large enterprise systems is beneficial.
