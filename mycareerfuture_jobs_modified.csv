Empowering enterprises to keep the planet habitable for all!

Reversing the impact of climate change is one of the world’s biggest challenges. And businesses have a responsibility to lead the way. While individual consumer choices are important, over 80% of all the emissions reductions necessary for the world to reach Net-Zero, require business-level action. But despite the growing momentum and ambition from companies around the world to set Net-Zero goals, there are significant challenges to delivering on these ambitions. Business leaders don’t really know how they will get there. And the very first step, of getting emissions measurement right, is hard.

Terrascope is an enterprise-grade, end-to-end decarbonisation SaaS platform. By combining AI-assisted carbon measurement & management with deep industry & sustainability expertise, Terrascope helps solve the data management, emissions reduction planning and implementation challenges that large enterprises face to decarbonise their operations and complex supply chains.

Having witnessed the achievements of the large models in 2023, there has been a new surge of machine learning and AI models in recent days, which again puts up the public concerns about the explosively increasing energy consumption during the model training phase. According to Dr. Sajjad Moazeni, an AI researcher at University of Washington, the training of GPT-3 roughly consumes 10 gigawatt-hour of electricity ^([1]), approximately equivalent to the daily electricity consumption of 440,000 average Singapore households in 2021 ^([2]).

Significant efforts have been devoted to improving the efficiency of the model training phase, in terms of hardware, model architecture, networking, and algorithm design, etc. The PI (Dr. Zhang Junyu) of this project would like to tackle this problem from the algorithmic perspective, by developing theoretical understanding of the open questions on the training algorithms, in terms of the convergence, complexity, local landscape properties, and potential algorithmic improvement based on the new theoretical findings.

For example, employing Pareto analysis helps prioritise corrective actions by identifying the most frequent quality issues.
· Implement root cause analysis (RCA) methodologies such as Ishikawa diagrams and 5 Whys to systematically investigate quality incidents, uncovering underlying causes and implementing preventive measures to forestall recurrence.

Develop Floor Tracking and Control Plans:
· Implement process/ technology to track work-in-progress (WIP) inventory movement in real-time, enabling accurate inventory management and production planning. Explore and implement systems/ processes to provide actionable insights for optimising production flow.
· Establish visual management tools such as Andon boards and production dashboards that display key performance metrics and highlight production abnormalities. Implementing standardised visual cues and color-coded status indicators enhances communication and facilitates rapid problem resolution on the production floor.

Assess Manufacturing Processes for New Products:
· Collaborate with design/ product development teams to conduct manufacturing feasibility studies and design for manufacturability (DFM) assessments, identifying potential manufacturing constraints early in the product development lifecycle. For instance, conducting feasibility/ tolerance analysis to ensure that product designs are compatible with existing production equipment and processes.
· Implement rapid prototyping techniques such as 3D printing and computer numerical control (CNC) machining to produce proof-of-concept prototypes for new product designs. Iterative prototyping and testing iterations refine product designs and validate manufacturing processes prior to full-scale production.

Develop Organisational Risk Management Frameworks:
· Create a risk register that catalogues potential hazards such as machine malfunctions, chemical spills, and ergonomic strains. For instance, implementing lockout/tagout procedures for equipment maintenance reduces the risk of accidental start-ups, safeguarding employee safety.

ABOUT VIZZIO
A WORLD CHANGING COMPANY
VIZZIO builds the world’s leading 3D modelling and visualisation software for city-scale digital twins and mission-critical dashboards for governments and enterprises.

We are recognized globally for producing meticulously detailed, precisely measured 3D digital building models using advanced satellite imagery and artificial intelligence—eliminating the need for drones or aerial photogrammetry.

We are a team of creative technologists on a mission to reimagine the art and science of 3D. We are a venture-backed startup creating a radically new kind of 3D modelling and visualisation technology. Powered by Deep Learning. We constantly experience things spatially. Our brains are constantly calculating distances, sizes, and volumes to understand the world around us. Videos fall flat and aren't interactive. Instead, an interactive, immersive 3D content gives more than visuals.

Our ambition is to forge photorealistic digital replicas of urban landscapes, enriched with semantic 3D data, made readily available for an array of uses including gaming, simulations, training, city planning, defence, sustainability and much more. Utilising advanced machine learning techniques, our algorithms deftly parse raw satellite imagery, while our geographic pipeline extracts semantic information about what's in the world. With each digital twin we build, our AI process becomes increasingly precise and reliable, surpassing the capabilities of aerial photogrammetry, producing positionally and geometrically accurate 3D maps.

We are creating the authoritative whole-Earth digital twin, built by AI, one city at a time. Real-world cities as immersive digital twins and rich 3D data, instantly accessible for games, simulations, training, architecture, and beyond. Our machine learning algorithms understand raw imagery data from satellites while our geographic pipeline extracts semantic information about what's in the world. The more data we have, the more accurate our system becomes.

Why Cisco
WE ARE CISCO
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.
We drive digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool.
Cisco is an Affirmative Action and Equal Opportunity Employer and you will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, genetic information, age, disability, veteran status, or any other legally protected basis.

About the job
At Datature, we are building a platform for training and deploying machine learning models swiftly without a single line of code. Datature Nexus is an MLOps platform that allows users to label unstructured data and construct complex machine learning pipelines all in their browser using highly visual editors.
Our users have leveraged our platform to solve problems in a myriad of verticals - from grading crops to optimizing manufacturing to identifying diseases from MRI scans. Datature levels the playing field for teams and companies in most industries to start AI-driven revolutions of their own.
The Scope 🔭
Datature's platform features multiple visual editors that convert raw, unstructured data to highly performant machine learning models. This requires a handful of services to work together seamlessly. You will be working with us on front-end interfaces such as our visual editor, image annotator tools, and solving problems with ReactJS, LeafletJS, Computational Geometry, and Large Data Rendering (2D/3D)
Our annotator is written primarily in Typescript and rendered with a combination of LeafletJS, WebGL, and other Computer Vision algorithms. Working with unstructured data is hard, but rendering them is harder - you will be working on building performant web components that will change the way machine learning engineers build on our platform.

Requirements ⚒
Minimum 2+ Years Experience in Engineering Frontend Applications
Experienced in TypeScript, ReactJS, Redux, NextJS and CSS3
Strong understanding of the React Virtual DOM and Lifecycles
Knowledge of modern authorization mechanisms, such as JSON Web Tokens
[Required] Experience Working with Interactive Components using Canvas API, LeafletJS, D3js or other graphically interactive projects
Experience with REST APIs, GraphQL and WebSockets
Interest in Building UI with Performance, Accessibility and Scalability In Mind
Experience with Cypress or other React/Frontend Testing Libraries
Knowledge in Graph Algorithms is a plus and Computational Geometry is ❤️
Having a knack for designing great UI and user journeys is always appreciated
About You 🤖
You don't need to have a Bachelor's or Masters of Computer Science to write great software. We are looking for a frontend guru who has built products that have shaped the lives of users and have a portfolio of meaningful side projects. If you have personal projects to flex or show us, it tells a better story than putting up a wall of 34 skills in the CV.
That said, we are looking for someone with a niche set of skills who can work on advanced rendering techniques and frameworks, leveraging front-end technologies.
Why You'll Love Us 🎈

Project Overview
We are seeking one or more Postdoctoral Associates in computer science to join the “Towards an Immersive Workplace” project. This project is part of Task “T1” of a five-year, ambitious research program on ""Mens, Manus and Machina—How AI Empowers People, Institutions and Cities in Singapore (M3S).""
Successful applicants for this position will have the opportunity to work on cutting-edge research that builds new capabilities for AI-enhanced human-robot interaction, with a special focus on supporting multi-modal natural instruction comprehension in industrial environments, such as airport tarmacs and logistics warehouses. The end goal is to build exciting new capabilities that allow robots and humans to work together, interactively and in close proximity, such that the robotic actions are controlled by commands and queries that humans would issue naturally in untethered, field settings.
This research will specifically look at the integration of 3D point-cloud data, generated by LIDAR sensors, into multi-modal instruction comprehension DNN models that additionally combine visual, verbal and gestural cues. Such comprehension will allow robots to clearly define a set of physical manipulation tasks, overcoming potential ambiguity and errors associated with comprehending instructions in cluttered and complex environments. Given the current state-of-the-art, the project will initially focus on tackling two novel challenges: (i) incorporating human and object kinematics into environmental context via use of temporal history of 3D sensing data, and (ii) developing DNN optimization techniques to support lightweight, accurate inference on resource-constrained embedded/robotic platforms. As subsequent steps, the research will explore how this process of comprehension can be further optimized by including awareness of the human instructor’s cognitive attention, which will be captured via advanced wearable devices being developed in complementary efforts within the overall T1 project.
The T1 team is led by distinguished scholars, including Profs. Sanjay Sarma, Daniela Rus and Jinhua Zhang from MIT; and Prof. Archan Misra from Singapore Management University. The proposed research described above will be spearheaded by Prof. Misra.
Job Description
Conduct and coordinate research on the design, development and testing of optimized algorithms for multi-modal human instruction comprehension.
Publish research results in top-tier conferences and journals, with focus on venues associated with human-robot interaction, mobile/embedded systems, AI and multimedia.
Participate in the mentorship and training of graduate and undergraduate students at MIT and in Singapore.
Assist in grant writing, project management, and other administrative duties related to research activities.
Job Requirements
Ph.D. in Computer Science, including Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, Mobile/Wearable Computing, Human-Robot Interaction and Multimedia Systems.
Experience in deep learning (audio, image), spatial and 3D computing and/or robotic systems applications highly desired.
Strong publication record in top-tier conferences and journals.
