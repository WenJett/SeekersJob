Job Description
About Elevate Tech
At Elevate Tech, we specialise in innovative predictive maintenance solutions that utilise IoT sensors, real-time data, and advanced A.I/M.L models. Our platform delivers valuable insights that help organisations reduce downtime, improve equipment performance, and optimise maintenance practices.

Our commitment to providing our clients with cutting-edge solutions is driven by a deep understanding of the importance of efficient maintenance practices in ensuring cost savings and increased efficiency.
Elevate Tech was established in 2019 with a mission to tackle the challenges faced by the vertical transportation industry and to solve problems that others have not. Issues such as a shortage of skilled labour and a lack of innovation have made the vertical transportation industry inefficient.

Utilise advanced planning and scheduling (APS) software to create dynamic production schedules that balance demand fluctuations with resource availability. Implementing finite capacity scheduling algorithms ensures realistic schedules that account for machine constraints and labour availability.
Employ lean production techniques such as single-piece flow and kanban systems to synchronize production activities, minimizing work-in-progress (WIP) inventory and reducing lead times from order placement to delivery.

Evaluate Quality Management Systems:
Deploy statistical process control (SPC) techniques like control charts and process capability analysis to monitor production processes in real-time, promptly detecting deviations from quality standards. For example, employing Pareto analysis helps prioritise corrective actions by identifying the most frequent quality issues.
Implement root cause analysis (RCA) methodologies such as Ishikawa diagrams and 5 Whys to systematically investigate quality incidents, uncovering underlying causes and implementing preventive measures to forestall recurrence.

Develop Floor Tracking and Control Plans:
Implement process/ technology to track work-in-progress (WIP) inventory movement in real-time, enabling accurate inventory management and production planning. Explore and implement systems/ processes to provide actionable insights for optimising production flow.

ABOUT VIZZIO
A WORLD CHANGING COMPANY
VIZZIO builds the world’s leading 3D modelling and visualisation software for city-scale digital twins and mission-critical dashboards for governments and enterprises.

We are recognized globally for producing meticulously detailed, precisely measured 3D digital building models using advanced satellite imagery and artificial intelligence—eliminating the need for drones or aerial photogrammetry.

We are a team of creative technologists on a mission to reimagine the art and science of 3D. We are a venture-backed startup creating a radically new kind of 3D modelling and visualisation technology. Powered by Deep Learning. We constantly experience things spatially. Our brains are constantly calculating distances, sizes, and volumes to understand the world around us. Videos fall flat and aren't interactive.

Our ambition is to forge photorealistic digital replicas of urban landscapes, enriched with semantic 3D data, made readily available for an array of uses including gaming, simulations, training, city planning, defence, sustainability and much more. Utilising advanced machine learning techniques, our algorithms deftly parse raw satellite imagery, while our geographic pipeline extracts semantic information about what's in the world. With each digital twin we build, our AI process becomes increasingly precise and reliable, surpassing the capabilities of aerial photogrammetry, producing positionally and geometrically accurate 3D maps.

We are creating the authoritative whole-Earth digital twin, built by AI, one city at a time. Real-world cities as immersive digital twins and rich 3D data, instantly accessible for games, simulations, training, architecture, and beyond. Our machine learning algorithms understand raw imagery data from satellites while our geographic pipeline extracts semantic information about what's in the world. The more data we have, the more accurate our system becomes.

AI Engineer Intern (IDX: 2024,"Your tasks
The focus of this internship will mainly be across 2 projects – Child Presence Detection and Perception for self-driving autonomous vehicles.
Child Presence Detection
In the automobile industry, the term “in-cabin monitoring” is used to describe the task of monitoring the driver or occupants within the vehicle using sensors such as cameras or radar transceivers. One such task is to be able to detect the presence of a child left behind unattended in the vehicle as an added safety feature onboard the vehicle.
This project aims to address this task by developing a machine learning classifier to detect the occupancy state within the vehicle and to flag scenarios where a child is left behind unattended using data from radar transceivers.
Multi-task, multi-modal perception for self-driving autonomous vehicles
Continental is developing AI technologies within the autonomous vehicle space for functions such as safety and parking (e.g., self-braking, fallback systems, self-parking).
As part of these technologies, this project aims to enhance an existing multi-task (3D object detection, lane detection, segmentation) and multi-modal (camera, lidar, radar) model by using unlabelled data in a self/semi-supervised manner for data-efficient learning.
For both projects, some possible tasks include the following:
Conducting in-depth review and analysis of the latest research and developments in the respective topics, gaining insights into their strengths and limitations.
Adapting state-of-the-art methods published in top tier AI conferences for internal Continental datasets and proposing innovative techniques to modify these methods given limitations in our use-cases.
Conducting rigorous evaluation and comparison of the proposed enhancements against known benchmarks using open and internal datasets.
Implementing cloud-based model deployment using AWS tools such as S3, Lambda, Sagemaker, for model training and finetuning in test vehicle environments.
Developing education material to champion the usage of AI in Continental business areas, explaining benefits and limitations of techniques used for each project especially to stakeholders who may not be proficient in AI fundamentals.
As an AI Engineer (Intern), you will be part of a multi-disciplinary AI R&D team with members spanning various AI disciplines such as NLP, CV, RL, and even niche areas such as Embedded AI, GNNs or xAI. You will work with global stakeholders and colleagues as part of the projects as well. This internship provides an excellent opportunity for talented individuals passionate about artificial intelligence and you will have the opportunity to be involved in developing AI technologies based on the latest cutting-edge research for real products in Continental.

Your profile
